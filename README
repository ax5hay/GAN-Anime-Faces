Dataset Downloaded From : https://www.kaggle.com/soumikrakshit/anime-faces
The size of the dataset as well as generated images exceeded the upload size limit so i've uploaded just the jupyter notebook.
I can however show the generated images in a directory if you desire.
The code was run without a GPU environment so it took longer than it should have.
I've created a new GPU Environment for further projects.
!mkdir shows already created folder because the I ran the code multipkke times so the directory already existed from the first run
Ran the code on 2 different operating systems hence the need for OSX integration.
